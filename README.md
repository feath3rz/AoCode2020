# Advent of Code 2020 (Python)
I decided to attempt completing Advent of Code 2020 to learn Python.  Overall it went pretty well.. I think there are a few times I did some by hand?

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is a coding challenge released during December from the 1st to the 25th. Each day you're given a challenge in two parts. The first part is often linked to how you handle the second part and you're awarded stars. The best of the best always seem to complete each challenge super fast. Days can be skipped unless a previous day's code relates to a following day (this is rare, I believe I only seen this happen one year).

##### My thoughts
Those who complete the challenge very fast have a mastery of the language and probably very quick reference libraries.  It is really amazing how skilled those people are.

## My Goal for 2020
I really wanted to learn Python since people seem to use it often and some said it was easy.  I believe "easy" is relative and it is different for every person. I love learning different languages and felt Python would be a fun one to attempt. Although I have learned Java in school, using a new language would be more fun and I learn best when I'm challenged.

## How it works (and my setup)
Advent of Code gives a data set which you process through your code to come up with a numerical answer. The data is different for each user so answers are not the same for everyone. The solver enters the answer that was determined by the code output. If it is correct, you get a star.
My setup:
- I will copy the text for each day at the top of my python code but you can view Part 1 of each day on the website which I will also link in the code.
- Part 2 cannot be seen by those who have not solved Part 1
- My code will follow.

## Important to Note
There are some important things to mention when looking at my code in this repository.
- The goal of Advent of Code is to solve the problem
- It is not always important to have the most efficient way to solve the problem
- As such, the code will likely look very rough and inefficient since once the solution is found, revising the code is not a priority
- Comments will also not be many (or at all) due to speed being the factor but I understand that extensive comments are necessary for code especially in business situations. Legacy is important and clarity to another coder is extremely important.
- My solutions for all of this was done without looking at other coder's solutions. I came up with my own, so it might look patchworky, but it's my own.

Here we go!

(I'm shy about this, but here goes nothing!)
